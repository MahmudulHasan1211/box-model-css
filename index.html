        <h2>Web Development</h2> <hr>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a variety of tasks and skills, ranging from designing the user interface to coding the functionality and ensuring the site operates smoothly on different devices and browsers. Web development can be broadly divided into three main categories: front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development.</p>

        <h2>Front-End Development</h2> <hr>
        <p>
            Front-end development, also known as client-side development, focuses on the part of the website that users interact with directly. It involves creating the visual layout, design, and interactive elements of a website. Key technologies used in front-end development include:
            
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages.
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a website.
            JavaScript: A programming language that enables interactive elements on web pages, such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and animations.</p>

        <h2>Back-End Development</h2> <hr>
        <p>Back-End Development
            Back-end development, or server-side development, deals with the server, database, and application logic that power a website. It focuses on how the website works and includes everything that happens behind the scenes. Key technologies and concepts in back-end development include:
            
            Server-Side Languages: Programming languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, and Node.js are used to build the server-side logic of a website.
            Databases: Databases store and manage the data used by a website. Common databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.
            APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): APIs allow the front-end and back-end of a website to communicate and exchange data. RESTful APIs and GraphQL are popular choices for web development.
            Server Management: Understanding server management and deployment, including the use of web servers like Apache or Nginx and cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.</p>
